Competition link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/deeptweets <br>
This is a tweet classification task where the tweets could be either Politics or Sports: Build a classifier in only 1 hour.<br>
this competition is guided by Kaggle and Oracle.<br>
We've tried to use 2 techniques, logistic regression classifier and convolutional neural network (CNN). The first one scored around 0.90 in the train session, but only 0.65 with the test file. While the second technique (CNN) Scored 0.94 in the training session and 0.80 with the test file.<br>
There is still some room for improvement.
